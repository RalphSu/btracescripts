# btracescripts

Btrace is a powerful tool dynamically print stack of given method (or even all methods), also able to print the caller stack.

It could be wired on dynamically, and when without script injected, it has small overhead to system.

This project just some example of btrace scripts that used by myself. For more detailed btrace usage, refer to btrace.io .
